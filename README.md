# Improper Exception Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient exception handling within asynchronous operations using `Future`s. The example shows a function fetching data from an API. While it includes a `try-catch` block, the `rethrow` statement might not provide the best user experience.  The solution offers more robust error handling.

## Bug
The `bug.dart` file contains the flawed code, which simply prints the error and then rethrows it. This can lead to unhandled exceptions and a poor user experience, particularly in UI contexts using `FutureBuilder` where the error is not gracefully handled.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.dart` file demonstrates how to handle exceptions more effectively.  Instead of a generic `print` and `rethrow`, the solution provides more informative error messages and uses a mechanism to notify the UI of the error, preventing application crashes and ensuring a better user experience.
